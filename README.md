## ðŸš€ About Me
Hello, I'm Muhammad Asim Chattha, a dedicated Computer Science student currently pursuing my studies at Air University in Islamabad, Pakistan.

### Encryption-Decryption Project

I'm excited to share my semester project, the Encryption-Decryption program, developed entirely in Assembly Language. This project is not just a coding exercise but a journey into the realm of secure data handling through the ingenious use of XOR bitwise operations.

### Project Overview

The Encryption-Decryption project functions seamlessly. Users input strings, which the program encrypts using XOR, and the encrypted data is then stored in a file. The intriguing part comes when users want to access and view the original form of the encrypted data â€“ a process seamlessly facilitated by the program.

## Deployment

For optimal deployment, run this project on DOSbox, and ensure you're using MASM615 as the assembler.

## Features

- **Enter Data:** Input your strings for encryption.
- **View Data:** Explore the encrypted data in its original form.
- **Store Data:** Securely store your information in an encrypted format.

This project not only showcases the capabilities of assembly language but also provides a hands-on experience with the intricacies of encryption using XOR.

Feel free to explore, contribute, and delve into the fascinating world of assembly language and encryption!
